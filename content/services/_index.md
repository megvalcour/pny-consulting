## Title IX Investigations

All public and private colleges and universities receiving federal financial assistance are prohibited under Title IX from discriminating on the basis of gender. On April 4, 2011, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the U.S. Department of Education issued a Dear Colleague Letter on student-on-student sexual harassment and sexual violence. The letter explains a school’s responsibility to respond promptly and effectively to sexual violence against students.

I have investigated more than 50 Title IX complaints involving students, faculty and staff. I can respond promptly to your current investigative needs or assist you in a review of your practices and policies as you act proactively to comply with state and federal mandates. At the conclusion of my work I will provide you with a comprehensive report and recommendations for remedial action.

## Workplace Investigations

Federal and state laws prohibit discrimination based on race, religion, age, ability, gender, and in some cases sexual orientation. Employers also have an obligation to comply with other employment laws such as the Family Medical Leave Act. I have performed more than 100 workplace investigations during my legal and HR career, including allegations of individual discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.

I believe that trust, integrity and impartiality are key to a fair investigative process that will result in a successful resolution. I can interview witnesses, gather and evaluate evidence, and work with you to uncover and remedy workplace conflicts at every level, both before and after any claim is filed. At the conclusion of my work I will provide you with a comprehensive report and recommendations for remedial action.

## Training and Workshops

As the old adage goes, “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”

Providing workshops will help your organization to prevent legal issues. Your staff will develop skills that will enable them to identify and assess common workplace problems. I have conducted workshops and training programs for senior management, supervisors, human resources professionals, salaried and hourly personnel. I can provide customized programs in the following employment-related areas: personnel management, harassment, discrimination, disability and religion accommodations, and ethics.

In addition, I have conducted a number of diversity and inclusion workshops, including workshops on cultural competency, welcoming diversity, affinity groups, bullying prevention and bystander awareness.
