    quote: "I have spoken on these issues, as a volunteer and college instructor, but working with Pam and learning from her knowledge and experience sharpened and organized my abilities as a presenter. At the same time, the actual work we are doing is strengthening and deepening understandings of racism and bias in our faith-based community here in Indiana."

## Personal Statement

For sometime now my career and faith have overlapped.  In fact, I call my transition for being an attorney to education and diversity, equity and inclusion work my epiphany.  Although born into a Baptist family for over two decades I have been an Episcopalian.

No church is perfect, but increasingly mine and others have decided to make racial reconciliation a priority.  I am convinced that for those of us who believe in salvation racial reconciliation is key. Neither me as a Black woman nor you whatever can enter into Heaven with hatred in our hearts. We need to believe in grace, in mercy, in forgiveness and reconciliation. To that end I offer to help any interested faith based group, congregation ,  church, temple or mosque explore questions regarding the intersection of faith  or religious beliefs and racial reconciliation.

My decision is intentional and heartfelt.  What interests me most is how I can move myself and others toward racial reconciliation for the glory of God.

**_While I can not offer this service at no cost, my goal is to offer it at cost.  I seek no financial gain._**

## Experience

My journey into my current occupation began as a journey of faith. In 1996, I was a practicing attorney in Springfield Massachusetts when the local Council of Churches organized a series of work crews to travel to Barnwell South Carolina to assist the rebuilding efforts of a Black Baptist church that had been the target of arson.  I was in the last crew to journey down.  Included in the hands on work were opportunities for crew members to discuss faith and race relations.  The facilitator assigned to work with our crew was unable to do so.  So, I volunteered.  I made a promise then to not shy away from these conversations and they have increasingly become the focus of my secular and non-secular life.

While no theologian, I have continued to educate myself about my faith tradition and others.  I completed   The Alpha Course,  participated in educational programs about Judaism, Islam and the Baha’I, attended training sessions at the Absalom Jones Episcopal Center for Racial Healing and most recently was a team member and facilitator for a training team in the Episcopal Diocese of Northern Indiana.

Since that time, I have been working for diversity equity, and inclusion in both my professional and personal life.

As my faith has grown so to the convergence of my work and my desire to work with faith-based groups. I started facilitating discussions for my church in 2018. I have attended training workshops at the [Absalom Jones Center for Racial Healing.](https://www.centerforracialhealing.org/)  My professional expertise, educational background, and passion for this work and faith ground my experience.

## Workshops

My workshops are designed to meet the individual needs of a congregation in consultation with lay and clergy leadership. Two or three workshops may be combined to  create a half day program or an individual workshop could be substituted for an extended Sunday school or special program.
