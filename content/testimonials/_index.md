{{< testimonial quote="I had the opportunity to work with Pamela while she served as Advisor to the President and Director of Institutional Diversity at Smith College from 2011 to 2014. Pamela worked with me and my office in a number of differing capacities. One of her most notable projects was the leadership of a comprehensive, strategic ADA review team for the college which provided information and resources to enable the college to set priorities in this complex area of compliance. Also under Pamela's leadership, the college was able to implement campus-wide training on Title IX/Sexual Assault Response. Pamela's team-oriented approach made committee work with her a pleasure. Lastly, her skill as an investigator on claims brought against the college by employees or in instances of student sexual assault was exceptional in both the comprehensiveness of the investigations and the compassion and kindness that she was able to convey to all the parties involved. I never detected any investigator bias in work; her reports were complete, balanced and fair. Her thoughtful, measured responses based in both her extensive knowledge of the law and her experience brought an astute perspective to our deliberations. Pamela would be a valuable asset to any organization." name="Beth Carmichael" occupation="Director of Compliance & Risk Management" organization="Five Colleges, Inc." >}}
