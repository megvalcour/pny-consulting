<h2 id="readings-for-institutions">Readings for Institutions</h2>
<p><strong>Are you looking for a non-threatening resource to prompt discussion of diversity and inclusion?</strong></p>
<p>I suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-If-Stories-Diversity-Dialogue/dp/0891062750">What If: Short Stories to Spark Diversity</a> by Steven L. Robbins. You will find the author’s personal narrative informative and benefit from his unique approach of demonstrating diversity and inclusion principles in an approachable, informative way. Robbins creates universal stories about home, business, and life in general that are highly educational. Read the book cover to cover or each chapter as a stand-alone. Many people and organizations have also found the Welcoming Diversity Workshops delivered by the National Coalition for Building Institute eye-opening. As an NCBI certified trainer, I have seen the impact they can have on participants.</p>
<p><strong>Are you having trouble creating a diversity strategic plan?</strong></p>
<p>If so, I am recommending a book recommended to me, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Multicultural-Organization-Capturing-Diversity/dp/0787955841">Creating the Multicultural Organization</a> by Dr. Taylor Cox Jr. Dr. Cox presents an innovative strategy for change. While his work has centered around managing workforce diversity, his methodology transcends industry and can be used universally. My colleague states he returns to it time and time again as he starts new initiatives or wants to assess ongoing initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Are you are having trouble with team dynamics?</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest Patrick Lencioni’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable</a>. Lencioni is the author of 10 books on organizational development. His use of fictional fables or parables allows the reader to easily understand the issue in order to arrive at the appropriate solution. His text can be used to guide a group through a series of discussions and exercises to improve team dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Does your interest in organizational development extend to the habits of individuals and organizations?</strong></p>
<p>If so, I suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X">The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do In Life And Business</a> by Charles Duhigg. Duhigg explains the science behind our habits and uses stories from business, the NFL, and the Civil Rights Movement to show how habits can be both made and broken. Read the book and think about the practices you would like to see changed in your life or organization.</p>
<p><strong>What does it take to do great work?</strong></p>
<p>We as individuals and the organizations we work for want to be stellar. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Work-Make-Difference-People/dp/0071818359">Great Work: How to Make a Difference People Love</a> by David Sturt with Chris Drysdale and Mark Cook of the O.C. Tanner Institute, you will learn five practical skills that will enable you to do great work. Easy to read and understand this is not your standard management book. This book filled with stories will entertain, energize, and enlighten you.</p>
<h2 id="resources-for-educators">Resources for Educators</h2>
<p>Are you an educator looking for resources for students?</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorites. Check out <a href="https://www.teachingtolerance.org/">Teaching Tolerance</a>, a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center. On their website you will find K-12 resources on a variety of diversity, social justice and equity issues. Educators can also find information on classroom discipline, webinars that provide professional development and advice on pedagogy. Join their “Mix it Up” campaign. Since 2002 schools around the nation have asked students to explore social boundaries on the last Tuesday in October.</p>
<p>Another favorite website is <a href="http://www.teachingforchange.org/">Teaching for Change</a>, another resource for both educators and parents. On their website you will find an online book store with titles for people aged 1 to 99, also on the website is an events calendar as well as resources for parents and professional development for educators.</p>
<p>Finally Teaching for Change in collaboration with Rethinking Our Schools supports the <a href="https://zinnedproject.org/">Zinn Project</a>. Using Howard Zinn’s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0060838655">A People’s History of the United States</a>, middle and high school students are encourage to engage in a more complex and accurate picture of United States History. The website offers free downloadable lesson plans by theme.</p>
<h2 id="personal-reading">Personal Reading</h2>
<p>Are you searching for a good thought-provoking read? Here are a few titles - some old, some new - that you should consider.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mountains-Beyond-Quest-Farmer-Would/dp/0812973011">Mountains Beyond Mountains</a> by Tracy Kidder, a look at global health and the opportunity to reflect on what a national health care system should be.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.beacon.org/Can-We-Talk-about-Race-P1060.aspx">Can We Talk about Race?</a> by Beverly Daniel Tatum. You might be surprised to learn that schools in the USA are re-segregating. What should our response be? Along the same line of thought, check Jonathon Kozol’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shame-Nation-Restoration-Apartheid-Schooling/dp/1400052459">The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America</a>.</li>
<li>Explore the difficulty of survival and the diminishing middle class dream in Barbara Ehrenreich’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nickel-Dimed-Not-Getting-America/dp/0312626681/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=48MFBTQWY6Z6K008Z6PK">Nickeled and Dimed</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bait-Switch-Futile-Pursuit-American/dp/0805081240">Bait and Switch</a>.</li>
<li>I read Claudia Rankin’s <a href="https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/citizen">Citizen</a> for the second time this year. VERY POWERFUL. My work as a diversity consultant often makes me question why we behave as we do. The science behind our actions fascinates me so I have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">Thinking Fast and Slow</a> by Kahneman on my next to read list as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Joy-Lasting-Happiness-Changing/dp/0399185046">The Book of Joy</a> by the Dalai Lama and Desmund Tutu, sometimes you need to remind yourself that greater powers are in control.</li>
