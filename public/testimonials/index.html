        Pamela Nolan Young presented a series of ADA/FMLA workshops to our service unions. She has the ability to take nuts and bolts information and make it accessible -- even lively -- to audiences not familiar with the subject. The information she gave was informative and helpful to our participants.

        Working with Pamela Nolan Young was an absolute pleasure! A seasoned professional with impeccable integrity, Pamela easily earned my trust and confidence. Most impressive was her keen insight, collaborative nature, and profound depth of knowledge of the law. Her ability to effectively navigate even the most difficult legal situations was exceptional.

        I had the opportunity to work with Pamela while she served as Advisor to the President and Director of Institutional Diversity at Smith College from 2011 to 2014. Pamela worked with me and my office in a number of differing capacities. One of her most notable projects was the leadership of a comprehensive, strategic ADA review team for the college which provided information and resources to enable the college to set priorities in this complex area of compliance. Also under Pamela&#39;s leadership, the college was able to implement campus-wide training on Title IX/Sexual Assault Response. Pamela&#39;s team-oriented approach made committee work with her a pleasure. Lastly, her skill as an investigator on claims brought against the college by employees or in instances of student sexual assault was exceptional in both the comprehensiveness of the investigations and the compassion and kindness that she was able to convey to all the parties involved. I never detected any investigator bias in work; her reports were complete, balanced and fair. Her thoughtful, measured responses based in both her extensive knowledge of the law and her experience brought an astute perspective to our deliberations. Pamela would be a valuable asset to any organization.

        Pam is an expert trainer and meeting planner. She pays attention to her audience and has a unique gift at making information interesting and pleasantly palatable.  She attracts top talent when selecting presenters. Her natural intelligence, political savvy, gracious demeanor , scenes of humor, superb organization skills, attention to detail and wealth of experience make working with her a professional pleasure. While employed at the Glen Urquhart School, I had attended several training meetings lead or organized by Pam Young, and I recommend her as a top professional in the field.
